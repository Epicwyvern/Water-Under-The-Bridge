      <p id="thoughts"><i>You take a closer look at the writing hung on the 
        wall.<br><br>It wasn't easy, but you managed to pick up writing in 
        Textura soon after you learned to speak in the language of humans.</i></p>

      <p id="words">"German" is what they call it.<br></p>

      <p id="thoughts"><i>The human people placed great import on names and ancestry and would 
        fiercely compete with others, which reminds you of the great wars of the trolls. The 
        Habsburgs against the Turks, who speak and look different, is one example. But then there is the 
        rivalry between the people of Hessen and the Thuringians, whom you think have much in common,
        and stranger still is the rivalry between Faldor's and Peter's farms. These were unlike the 
        rivalries of the trolls.<br><br>Indeed, you might know how to read and write like the humans,
        but there is still much to learn. While those in Hessen now think of you as a friend,
        the people of other villages and towns are still hesitant, despite Faldor's reassurances.

      <p id="words">I thought me first words were written good, but Chester had a lot to say 
        about that...</p>

      <p id="thoughts"><i>Chester taught you the intricacies of Textura at his kitchen whenever you 
        took a break at the farm, but he passed away before you could learn fully. You hang these
       first few words in his name.</i></p>
