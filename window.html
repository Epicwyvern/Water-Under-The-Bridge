          <p id="thoughts"><i> You peer out of the window to see Hessen enjoying a late autumn afternoon. The 
           sky is slowly darkening, and zwielicht fast approaches.<br><br> Far off from the west you 
           hear the yelling of a concerned mother, with bits of childish laughter in between.</i><br></p>

          <p id="thoughts"><i> Fallen leaves eddy in the chill breeze from the north. Another week or so and
            you might see the first snows of winter.<br><br> You weren't particularly fond of the winter. 
            "Seasons" that "change" are a novelty for you; the world beyond the bridge wasn't always 
            snowing. You want to enjoy the reds, yellows, and browns a little bit more before the 
            monotonous white.</i></p>
