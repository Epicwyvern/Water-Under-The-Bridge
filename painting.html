        Adjusting to life in Hessen was not easy (even though they were unaware of your
        past misdeeds). As a troll that lived among humans, you struck fear in some and 
        drew the ire of others, but she was one of the first to open up
         to you. Trolls didn't have such a good reputation in these parts (You blame yourself
         and the state of trolls under Hrungnir at large), but her 
         example lead the others in Hessen to see you as a friend.<br></i></p>

      <p id="thoughts"><i>The troll chiefs did not believe in mingling with others, 
        humans even less so. They argued that humans were unable to understand the
        ways and needs of trolls, though in your eyes this is far from the truth.<br><br>
      Yet you are no ordinary troll, are you?</i></p>
