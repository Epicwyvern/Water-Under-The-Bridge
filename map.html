        <p id="thoughts"><i>You still aren't used to the south. Being stuck at the bridge up 
        north for such an age made it hard to grasp the lay of the land.<br><br>You squint at the map of 
        Germania until you make out Hessen, with Steckelberg lying just below.</i><br></p>

        <p id="words">Ah, there it is!<br></p>

        <p id="thoughts"><i>You trace your way from Hessen to Steckelberg.</i><br></p>

        <p id="words"> First to Fuld down the river Fulda, and then to Ostheim. 10 leagues 
        southwest from there...</p>

        <p id="thoughts"><i>As you continue thinking about the path to Steckelberg, you begin
        tracing backwards along the river Fulda, past Fuld and even Hessen. At one moment in time, you 
        used to guard the bridge crossing over it at Munden, stopping many a merchant on their 
        ventures.<br><br>In another, the Fulda carried you from your fall all the way to Hessen. In some 
        twist of fate, you seem to be in the merchant's shoes now.</i><br></p>

        <p id="words"> The harvest is mostly dealt with, so I'll talk with Faldor and set out first 
        thing in the morning.</p>
