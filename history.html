        <p>Trolls are the peoples of the rocks, the caves, and the mountains. We 
        were cut from the first stone, existing since the dawn of first day.<br><br>
        
        We lived in the darkness of our homes, away from those that could see.
        Denizens of the dark, we had no need for eyes, yet we could hear all—the 
        song of the stones, the echo of the mountains, and the hum of the Earth.

        <p>Above all else, we trolls could hear the songs of our kin. We 
          understood each other and lived in perfect harmony.<br><br>

        That is, until the great Betrayer Forath was born.<br><br>

        Forath was a troll born with ears that were weak; he could not
        hear the songs of his brethren. Yet he discovered the secrets of the eye,
        and so became the first troll with the gift of sight.<br><br>

        The Betrayer reveled in his newfound gift, and imparted it upon those that 
        followed him. He was restless as he could not hear well, or see much in the 
        darkness of the caves and mountains. When he gathered other trolls to venture 
        beyond our lands, we denied him. Yet he persisted.<br><br>
        
        We told him that his departure was an omen of doom, that his lineage would 
        bring strife and shatter the unity of all Trolldom, yet he took his 
        people and left.<br><br>

        Such is the truth of the seclusion and enimity of Trolldom today.

        <br><br>
        
        <p class="writing">Me name is Aurvandil of the Fyrnil, as given to me by Nött of the Fyrnil, me father. It is the 
          only heritage, along with these few pages of the Tröllaslagur, that I possess.<br><br>

        I have not been initiated in the ways of our songs or poetry. Me life was
        spent as a prisoner, though fate pitied me and I wound up living in a strange 
        land. I learned to write in the tongue of the human. It might not hold a candle
        to the brilliance of me forebears, though I believe it fit to record the fleeting
        history of the Fyrnil (of whom I might be the last) in our Tröllaslagur.<br><br>

        Me recollection of events is hazy at best, but from memory I know that we were a small clan
        allied with the Ymir, the last Chieftans of Trolldom. We enjoyed relative peace until the 
        Tyrant King Hrungnir came with his host to claim the throne.<br><br>

        The fires of war smoldered, and our tribe was sent out in an advanced party by the Ymir 
        along with a few others. We were promised support by the Ymir in an ambush strategy, yet only when 
        the Hrungil were at our gates did we find that the Ymir had turned tail and ran.<br><br>
        
        I was a wee troll babe when it all happened, and, outnumbered ten to one, only the children were 
        spared in the ensuing massacre. We remaining few were sent to far off lands to pillage others of 
        their wealth, cut off from our kin and seperated.<br><br>

        I know not if this will be found, but I write this portion of the Tröllaslagur to record the  
        treachery of the Ymir and the barbarianism of the Hrungil. Let all of Trolldom bear witness, and 
        may Trolldom see peace in the future once more.
